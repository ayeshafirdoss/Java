Problem: The Temperature Converter

You are working as a software developer at a weather forecasting company. The company is developing a new feature for their app that allows users to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Your task is to create a method that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius.

Hint: The formula to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

C = (F - 32) * 5/9

Where:

- C is the temperature in Celsius

- F is the temperature in Fahrenheit

Class Definition:

public class TemperatureConverter {

public double convertFahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit);

}

Inputs:

The method convertFahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit) will receive one parameter:

- fahrenheit : a double representing the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Outputs:

The method will return a double - the temperature converted to Celsius.

Sample Input:

TemperatureConverter temperatureConverter = new TemperatureConverter();

temperatureConverter.convertFahrenheitToCelsius(68.0);

Sample Output:

20.00

Note:

In the sample input, the user's temperature in Fahrenheit is 68.0. The temperature in Celsius is (68 - 32) * 5/9 = 20.00, so the method returns 20.00 as the output. Your method will be crucial in helping users understand the temperature in Celsius. Good luck, developer!
