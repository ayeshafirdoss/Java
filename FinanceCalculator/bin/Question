**Problem: The Finance Calculator**

You are a software developer at a financial technology company. The company is building a new feature in their app that calculates the simple interest for users wanting to take out loans. Your task is to create a method that calculates the simple interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

**Hint:** The formula to calculate simple interest is:

I = P * R * T

Where:

- I is the simple interest

- P is the principal amount

- R is the rate of interest (in decimal)

- T is the time (in years)

**Class Definition:**

public class FinanceCalculator {

public double calculateSimpleInterest(double principal, double rate, double time);

}

**Inputs:**

The method calculateSimpleInterest(double principal, double rate, double time) will receive three parameters:

- principal (1 ≤ principal ≤ 10^9): a double representing the principal amount.

- rate (0 ≤ rate ≤ 1): a double representing the rate of interest in decimal.

- time (1 ≤ time ≤ 10^5): a double representing the time in years.

**Outputs:**

The method will return a double - the simple interest.

**Example:**

**Sample Input:**

FinanceCalculator calculator = new FinanceCalculator();

calculator.calculateSimpleInterest(1000.0, 0.05, 2.0);

**Sample Output:**

100.00

**Note:**

In the sample input, the principal amount is 1000.0 units, the rate of interest is 0.05, and the time is 2.0 years. The simple interest is 1000.0 * 0.05 * 2.0 = 100.00, so the method returns 100.00 as the output. Your method will be crucial in helping users plan their finances. Good luck, developer!
