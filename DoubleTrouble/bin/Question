Problem: The Double Trouble

You are participating in a coding competition at your school. The challenge is to create a function that can double the value of any number provided. This function will help in the game design where scores need to be doubled under certain conditions.

Function:

public static int doubleTheNumber(int num);

Inputs:

The function doubleTheNumber(int num) will receive one parameter:

- num : an integer which represents the number to be doubled.

Outputs:

The function will return an integer - the result of doubling the num.

Sample Input:

doubleTheNumber(15);

Sample Output:

30

Note:
In the sample input, the number given to the function is 15. The double of this number is 15*2=30, so the function returns 30 as the output. Your function should work accurately to make sure you win this competition. Good Luck!
