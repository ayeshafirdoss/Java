Problem: The Cube Mystery

You are a software engineer developing an innovative educational game for kids. This game helps kids understand the concept of cubes in a fun and interactive way. In one of the stages, the kids are given a number and they have to find out the cube of that number to solve a mystery. Your task is to create a function that will calculate the cube of a given number.

Function:

public static int cubeNumber(int num);

Inputs:

The function cubeNumber(int num) will receive one parameter:

- num : an integer which represents the number that the player has to cube.

Outputs:

The function will return an integer - the cube of num.

Example:

Sample Input:

cubeNumber(3);

Sample Output:

27

Note:

In the sample input, the kid is at a stage where the number to cube is 3. The cube of this number is 3*3*3=27, so the function returns 27 as the output. The function you develop will be essential in helping the kids solve the Cube Mystery. Good luck, game engineer!
