**Problem: The Height Converter**

You are part of a sports data management team. The team is developing a new feature for their application where the heights of players, currently recorded in inches, need to be displayed in feet for an international audience. Your task is to create a method that takes a height given in inches and converts it into feet.

**Hint:** The conversion factor from inches to feet is 1 foot = 12 inches.

**Class Definition:**

public class HeightConverter {

public double convertInchesToFeet(double inches);

}

**Inputs:**

The method convertInchesToFeet(double inches) will receive one parameter:

- inches (0 ≤ inches ≤ 10^9): a double representing the height in inches.

**Outputs:**

The method will return a double - the height converted to feet.

**Example:**

**Sample Input:**

HeightConverter converter = new HeightConverter();

converter.convertInchesToFeet(72.0);

**Sample Output:**

6.00

**Note:**

In the sample input, the height of the player is 72.0 inches. The height in feet is 72/12 = 6.00, so the method returns 6.00 as the output. Your method will be crucial in helping the sports data management team present the data in a format familiar to the international audience. Good luck, data manager!
