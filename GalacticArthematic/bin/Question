Problem: Galactic Arithmetic

In a far-off galaxy named Arithmetica, beings have been using a newly discovered number system to make their life easier. However, they are facing difficulties in performing basic arithmetic operations. As the resident genius of planet Earth, you have been called upon to help them. Your first task is to build a function that will be able to add two numbers in their number system.

Function:

public static long galacticAddition(long num1, long num2);

Inputs:

The function galacticAddition(long num1, long num2) will receive two parameters:

- num1 : a long integer representing the first number in the Arithmetica number system.

- num2 : a long integer representing the second number in the Arithmetica number system.

Outputs:

The function will return a long - the sum of num1 and num2 in the Arithmetica number system.

Sample Input:

125678

9876543210L

Sample Output:

9876668888L

Note:
In the sample input, the two numbers provided to the function are 125678 and 9876543210. The sum of these two numbers is 125678+9876543210=9876668888, so the function returns 9876668888 as the output. Your task is to help the beings of Arithmetica perform this basic operation with ease. Good luck, Earth's genius!
